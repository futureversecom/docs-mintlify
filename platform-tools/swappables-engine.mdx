The Swappables Engine is a comprehensive toolkit tailored for developers who want to enable seamless connection and disconnection of ancillary collectibles to a main collectible. These collectibles include wearables ranging from clothing and fashion accessories to vehicle parts, which are visual elements that adapt and blend with the asset they are rendered on. The engine allows for metadata associated with these wearables and other collectibles to be grouped or ungrouped, facilitating their presentation and trade collectively or individually. This versatile approach ensures the interoperability of these assets, enabling them to be represented seamlessly across various experiences, spaces and games within the open metaverse.

The Swappables Engine, including its wearables function, is designed for developers crafting apps, games, and digital experiences. It is an ideal solution for those seeking to provide users with the freedom to personalize their collectibles.

    title="What challenges does this product resolve?
"
>
Traditional digital collectibles are often traded as a single, static unit, where accessories like sunglasses or clothing, are permanently affixed to the original design. This lack of flexibility limits users' ability to personalize or adapt their collectibles over time. Also typically these these collectibles often don't work well in gaming engines, offering only basic "PFP" or art experiences. However, developers integrating the Swappables Engine, with its wearables function, can usher in a new era of customization, tradability, and creativity for users. This enables them to modify their collectibles in tune with evolving fashion trends or effortlessly swap in new accessory collectibles from the latest releases and enable these to work inside game experiences.

The Swappables Engine also enhances customization by allowing different developers to create interoperable collections. This flexibility not only empowers users but also opens up new opportunities for developers to offer a broader range of wearables and collectibles, driving increased engagement and revenue.

    title="What is Wearables and how does it differ from Swappables?
"
>
Wearables are a specific function or extension of the Swappables Engine, focused on visual elements that need to adapt and blend depending on the asset they are rendered on—such as clothing and accessories. While under the hood, wearables function similarly to other non-wearable items within the Swappables Engine, the key difference lies in their visual adaptability. For example, a jacket designed as a wearable can be rendered to fit any character, whether it's a TNL fighter, a party bear, or a goblin, ensuring an interoperable solution. This adaptability is achieved through focused R&D, ensuring the wearables are fit for purpose and scalable for current and future products.
