| **ABI**                 | The Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI) is the standard way to interact with contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem, both from outside the blockchain and for contract-to-contract interaction. A smart contract's ABI allows it to communicate and interact with external applications and other smart contracts.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Auth**                | It is an all-in-one smart wallet. Auth is a unified platform to manage identity data, assets, permissions, and status across various apps, experiences, and worlds, ensuring a simpler and safer journey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Chain**               | Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. The data is chronologically consistent because you cannot delete or modify the chain without consensus from the network.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Chain ID**            | It is a unique identifier that represents a blockchain network. It can be used in an application to distinguish different blockchain networks from each other and to ensure that transactions and messages are sent to the correct network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Client ID**           | The `client_id` is a public identifier for apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Client Secret**       | The `client_secret` is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Contract Address**    | It is a unique identifier for a smart contract deployed on a blockchain. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that follow predefined rules and automatically enforce actions when specific conditions are met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Custodial Wallets**   | Custodial wallet is a wallet in which a third party (usually a crypto exchange) is responsible for managing your private keys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **EOA**                 | Externally Owned Accounts. They are the most common type of blockchain account for direct control. These accounts are created using private keys. The associated key gives you a unique signature and access to the blockchain, which can be used to send and receive transactions and interact with applications.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Extrinsic**           | Particularly in Substrate-based blockchains like Polkadot, "extrinsic" are actions or transactions that originate from an external source, outside of the blockchain runtime, and are submitted to the blockchain for processing. Extrinsic is a term specific to Substrate's framework.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Gas**                 | It is a measure of how much it costs to perform a transaction or execute a contract on the blockchain. Gas prices are based on supply and demand for the network's validation requests. This cost is defined using the gas limit, which is the cost per unit of computation the user is willing to pay, and the gas price, which is the cost per unit of computation they are willing to pay.                                                                             |
| **ID Token**            | The primary extension that OpenID Connect makes to OAuth 2.0 to enable End-Users to be Authenticated is the [ID Token data structure](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken). The ID Token is a security token that contains Claims about the Authentication of an End-User by an Authorization Server when using a Client, and potentially other requested Claims. The ID Token is represented as a JSON Web Token (JWT).                        |
| **Linked wallets**      | Linked wallets are secondary cryptocurrency wallets that are connected to a primary wallet or account, allowing users to access and manage funds from multiple wallets within a single interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Non-Custodial**       | Non-custodial wallets are a type of wallet in which the crypto owner holds their own private key and, therefore, their funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Nonce**               | Number used to protect private communications by preventing replay attacks. Nonces are random or pseudo-random numbers that authentication protocols attach to communications. In Ethereum, this number is contained within a transaction payload to keep track of the number of transactions the address has sent. This value ensures that transactions sent from the wallet are executed in order and cannot be replayed.                                               |
| **OICD**                | [OpenID Connect](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol#:~:text=OpenID%20Connect%20\(OIDC\)%20is%20an,obtain%20basic%20user%20profile%20information.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Pass address**        | A Pass Address is a unique blockchain address designed for managing and securing digital assets across platforms. Unlike traditional accounts, it centralizes ownership and simplifies transactions, enhancing security. It also supports fee proxy mechanisms, letting users pay transaction fees in their preferred tokens, making it user-friendly and versatile for blockchain interactions.                                                                          |
| **Signer**              | An abstraction on externally owned wallet accounts allowing the signing of messages, transactions, and TRN pallet extrinsics. A Signer allows you to verify that you own a particular account so that you can send transactions to the blockchain from that account.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Signed transactions** | These are a type of transactions that must include the signature of an account sending an inbound request to execute some runtime call. The sender signs the transaction using their private key, demonstrating ownership of the assets being transferred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Signed messages**     | Message signing is the action of signing a cryptographic message using a private key and its associated address to prove that you have access to the address. Wallets can verify these messages by checking the signature against the address to see if they correspond to each other. The result of a message signing is often called a signed message.                                                                                                                  |
| **Slippage**            | It is the difference between the expected price of an order and the price when the order actually executes. The slippage percentage shows how much the price for a specific asset has moved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Transactions**        | Transactions in a blockchain are fundamental data units that represent a transfer of value or the execution of a specific action within the blockchain network. They are the building blocks of the blockchain and are used to record changes to the ledger securely and verifiable. There are three types of Ethereum network transactions:  transferring cryptocurrency from one account to another, deploying a smart contract, and interacting with a smart contract. |
| **Wallet Address**      | It is a unique string of randomly generated series of alphanumeric characters used to send and receive digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). A wallet address typically identifies the wallet’s location on a blockchain network.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
