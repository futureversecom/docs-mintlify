Futureverse Transact is an agnostic JavaScript solution designed to simplify transactions on [The Root Network](https://www.therootnetwork.com/) (TRN) pallets. It provides developers with a variety of tools for effortless actions, such as minting an NFT, transferring an asset, or batching multiple transactions.

The library targets The Root Network pallets, handling layers of queries and logic behind the scenes. It makes it easier for developers new to Web3 or coming from other chains, such as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) or [Solana](https://solana.com/), to perform transactions smoothly using the class-based functionalities in their applications.

Futureverse Transact supplies methods and helper functions that significantly reduce the time you spend on your application and the number of lines of code you need to perform simple transactions, such as minting, burning, or transferring assets on The Root Network. It also simplifies more complex actions, such as batching multiple transactions, and allows you to create and customize your logic to best meet your needs.

The library also grants easy access to relevant information, such as Gas details, a Message to Sign, and the TRN message, which are usually costly and time-consuming to obtain. It can be easily integrated with other Futureverse Platform tools.
