Auth React and Wagmi require [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), added during the Auth React [installation](https://docs.futureverse.com/dev/authentication/getting-started/installation). The library enables fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating asynchronous data in your React application.

You need to import and instantiate `QueryClient`. The initialized variable `queryClient` will be sent as a property of [`QueryClientProvider`](https://docs.futureverse.com/dev/authentication/providers/queryclientprovider) to the children's application.&#x20;

### Example:&#x20;

```typescript
import { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();
```

For more information on [QueryClient](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/reference/QueryClient) and [QueryClientProvider](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/QueryClientProvider#queryclientprovider), refer to the [TanStack Query Documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).
