title: "FutureverseAuthProvider"
---

It supplies session-related methods and variable objects to the children and exposes the following properties:

-   `signer`
    
-   `signIn()`
    
-   `signOut()`
    
-   `authClient`
    
-   `userSession`
    
-   `authMethod`
    
-   `isFetchingSession`
    

<Info>Information and examples of the properties above can be found on the [`useAuth()`](https://docs.futureverse.com/dev/authentication/hooks/useauth) page.</Info>

In the code below, we instantiate `FutureverseAuthClient` and pass the initialized variable `authClient` as the provider's property.

`authClient` is a required property.

Example:

``` typescript

    import { FutureverseAuthClient, FutureverseWagmiProvider, FutureverseAuthProvider } from '@futureverse/auth-react';
    import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
    
    const authClient = new FutureverseAuthClient({
      clientId,
      environment: 'production',
      redirectUri: '<your-app-redirect-endpoint>',
    });
    
    ...
        <FutureverseAuthProvider authClient={authClient}>
          {children}
        </FutureverseAuthProvider>
    ...
```
