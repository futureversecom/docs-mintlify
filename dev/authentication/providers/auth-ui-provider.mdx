Futureverse [Auth UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@futureverse/auth-ui) allows developers to use an optional ready-to-use UI solution with a handy modal that includes all the prebuilt functionalities for login/signup options. It also allows complete customization to meet diverse application needs.

### Features

-   Plug-and-play component
    
-   Customizable Theme
    
-   In-built localisation
    

### Plug and Play Modal

Developers who opt to use the plug-and-play modal will need to import, set up, and wrap their children's components with `FutureverseAuthUiProvider`. It enables the Auth UI sign-in model to be shown. The modal exposes all the Web3 / Custodial Web2 options and handles connecting.

#### Example:

``` typescript
import { AuthUiProvider, type ThemeConfig } from '@futureverse/auth-ui';

// Theme customized example
const customThemeConfig: ThemeConfig = {
  ...DefaultTheme,
  defaultAuthOption: 'web3',
  images: {
    logo: '<optional logo svg / image>',
    background: '<optional background image>',
  },
};

...
    <AuthUiProvider authClient={authClient} themeConfig={customThemeConfig}>
      {children}
    </AuthUiProvider>
...
```
<Info>Customisation of the Auth UI is achievable through the [Theme Config](https://docs.futureverse.com/dev/authentication/theme-config)[.](https://docs.futureverse.com/dev/authentication/theme-config)</Info>

### `signInFlow` in `authClient`

Developers who opt to use the Auth UI plug-and-play modal also must update the `authClient` configuration, which was previously shown in the [FutureverseAuthClient](https://docs.futureverse.com/dev/authentication/configuration/futureverseauthclient) section. The `authClient` must include a `signInFlow` parameter and `'popup'` option as its value.

#### Example:

``` typescript
export const authClient = new FutureverseAuthClient({
  clientId,
  environment: 'staging',
  redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/fp',
  signInFlow: 'popup',
});
```
