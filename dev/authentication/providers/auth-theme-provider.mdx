title: "AuthThemeProvider"
---

Futureverse [Auth UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@futureverse/auth-ui) gives developers the flexibility to implement custom CSS and create their own components for login/signup on their applications. Using the `AuthThemeProvider`, developers can access the library's color palette to use or customize the options provided.

To provide Auth UI color values to the root of their application, you need to wrap your children's components with the `AuthThemeProvider` instead of `AuthUiProvider`.

#### Example:

``` typescript
import { AuthThemeProvider, ThemeConfig } from '@futureverse/auth-ui';


...
    <AuthThemeProvider authClient={authClient} themeConfig={ThemeConfig}>
      {children}
    </AuthThemeProvider>
...
```
