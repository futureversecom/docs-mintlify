Before using Auth React, you will need to register an [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/) client with the Auth Online Identity Provider using the Manage Clients Console:

* **Production:** [https://login.pass.online/manageclients](https://login.pass.online/manageclients)

* **Development / Staging:** [https://login.passonline.cloud/manageclients](https://login.passonline.cloud/manageclients)

To register your client, you will need to provide two arguments:

* **Client Name:** The name of your application (e.g. `futureverse-experience-demo`).

  * Use only alphanumeric characters, `-` and `_` .

<Info>
  **Note**: The name does not have to be unique; you can re-register using the same name to receive a fresh set of credentials.
</Info>

* **Redirect URLs:** Specify your application's URL(s) to redirect to after a successful login. Please pay attention to these guidelines:

  * Include the protocol in the URL (use `http` for development and `https` for production).

  * Separate multiple URLs using a semicolon.

  Example:

  ```bash
  <http://localhost:3000/login>; <http://futureverse.vercel.com/home>; <https://futureverse-experience-demo.staging.com/home>;
  ```

Once your registration is successful, you will receive a Client ID, Name, and an Access Token. Make sure to save this information. You will need the Client ID and the Redirect URL to instantiate the `FutureverseAuthClient` and configure the providers in your application. Treat them as any other secrets in your application (Do not commit them with your code!).

<Info>
  **Note**: Client Name and Access Token are used to view and edit this registration; they are not required in the codebase.
