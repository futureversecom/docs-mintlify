We offer an out of the box built-in translations without any configurations required. By default, we support the `en`locale for English language users. If available, we will detect your user's [language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/language) and choose the applicable locale translations. Developers are always able to override the default language and have their own method of providing a locale and a suitable fallback.

To specify a language, simply add `locale="ca"` as a prop to your `AuthUiProvider`.

``` typescript
import { AuthUiProvider } from '@futureverse/auth-ui';

export default function App() {
  return <AuthUiProvider locale="ca">{/* Your App */}</AuthUiProvider>;
}
```

<Info>If a passed in locale is not supported, then the default fallback language is English.</Info>

## Supported Languages
